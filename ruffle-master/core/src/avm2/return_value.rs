/// It is a panicking logic error to attempt to run AVM2 code while any
/// reachable object is in a locked state. Ergo, it is sometimes necessary to
/// be able to return what *should* be called rather than actually running the
/// code on the current Rust stack. This type exists to force deferred
/// execution of some child AVM2 frame.
///
/// It is also possible to stuff a regular `Value` in here - this is provided
/// for the convenience of functions that may be able to resolve a value
/// without needing a free stack. `ReturnValue` should not be used as a generic
/// wrapper for `Value`, as it can also defer actual execution, and it should
/// be resolved at the earliest safe opportunity.
///
/// It is `must_use` - failing to resolve a return value is a compiler warning.
